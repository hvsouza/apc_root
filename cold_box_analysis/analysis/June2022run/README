DATA taking log
Digitizer: CAEN DT5730SB
Sample rate: 500 MSamples/s (2 ns step)
Samples: 5000 (10 us total)
Digitizer: 2 Vpp 14 Bits (0.122 mV/ADC)
DC offset: 10% (Ch2 showed a different offset, probably internal configuration of the digitizer)
Pretrigger: 40%

Acquisition done with Wavedump.
Each binary file has 10,000 events. The data is saved 6 headers and nsamples of data. 4 bytes per header and 2 bytes per sample. Please, refer to the wavedump manual.
