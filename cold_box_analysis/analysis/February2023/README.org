NOTE: Channels label were swaped in the Koheron for v4 and v5. The values labeled here are correct.

* 20230213

** Offset measured:
Argon2x2
- 217.6 mV
Argon4
- 36.8 mV
** Noise check cable A
Long (1 ms) waveforms for FFT. 500 Events each file.
- Data was taken with the usual power supplies, argon2x2 and argon4
- Changed to SSP power supply (set by Xavier) and acquired data again

* 20230214
** Offset measured:
Argon2x2
- 216 mV
Argon4
- 39.1 mV
v4 Ch1
- 144 mV
v4 Ch2
- 6 mV
v5 Ch1
- 109 mV
v5 Ch2
- 140 mV
** Random trigger

Random trigger data switching on system slowly.

** LED
- Performed SPE calibration for all devices using 275 nm led

* 20230215
** Offset measured:
Argon2x2
- 218 mV
Argon4
- 37.8 mV
v4 Ch1
- 144 mV
v4 Ch2
- 6.2 mV
v5 Ch1
- 108 mV
v5 Ch2
- 139 mV

** LED
- Performed SPE calibration for all devices using 275 nm led
- First run with 275 nm will have weird waveforms. There was a problem in the LED

** DCemHD xArapucaV1
- LED data taking for SPE calibration


** Random trigger
- Another set of random trigger to evaluate light leakage

* 20230216
** Offset measured:
- Only inspection by eye, all looked ok. We can take the offset from the ADC (I was in too much a hurry and could not lose time)
** SPE
- Repeated the SPE calibration, only with 10k events
** Cosmic
- Measured using self-trigger with two different triggers, one at about 10 pe and another at about 100 pe. for each channel
- Acquisition of 2000 wvfs per trigger, 70% post-trigger, 10 us (2500 pts)
** CRT
- Data taken using CRT, trigger rate of about ~2 Hz.
- CRP data was collected using the same trigger. Run 19503
- 10 us, 70 post-trigger
** DCemHD 47V
- DCemHD was changed to the 47V SiPMs. Three different LED intensities were used for spe calibration

* 20230217
** Random trigger
- Only cathode system on
