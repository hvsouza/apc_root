v4 had offset but no SiPM signals. Sabrina figured it out that the problem was lack of power. \\
I have checked the two fibers, both looked ok, and I carefully cleaned it and increase the power on laser 2 and 3.\\
Laser 2: 642 mW -> 890 mW\\
Laser 3: 630 mW -> Around 900 mW (the powermeter had problems after)\\
The offset measured before was 56 mV Ch1 and 95 mV Ch2\\
This changed to 72 and 109 mV, and signals went back\\

** Offset measured:
Argon2x2
- 211 mV: 2550 ADCs at 5%
v4 Ch1
- 72 mV: 1410 ADCs at 5% after increased power
v4 ch2
- 109 mV: 1720 ADCs at 5% after increased power
v5 Ch1
- 147 mV: 2030 ADCs at 5%
v5 Ch2
- 16 mV: 950 ADCs at 5%

** Random trigger (HV study)
- CRP see 350 kHz when switching on v5
- Between run2 and run3, the power supply for the Koherons was change
- The power of the PoF was adjust before the last run of random trigger
** SPE
- Data was taken with Argon2x2, v4 and v5 all powered at the same time.

** Offset measured:
Argon2x2
- 211 mV: 2550 ADCs at 5%
v4 Ch1
- 72 mV: 1410 ADCs at 5%
v4 ch2
- 109 mV: 1720 ADCs at 5%
v5 Ch1
- 147 mV: 2030 ADCs at 5%
v5 Ch2
- 16 mV: 950 ADCs at 5%

** Noise level:
- Measurements of Koheron only
** SPE:
- SPE measurements done with one device turned one by time
** LED Dynamic range
- Measurements with LED at 365 nm for dynammic range
- After first round, connected attenuator of 10 dB and 5 dB to ch1 and ch2
  - V4 first:\\
    365 nm LED\\
    275 nm LED for possibly speak
  - V5\\
    365 nm LED\\
    275 nm LED for possibly speak

v5 Ch2
- 16 mV: 950 ADCs at 5%



** SPE
For SPE of argon2x2 (run2), PoF was off
** LED
Recheck of dynamic range using 5 dB attenuator for ch1

** For CRT + CRP data
The first run failed..\\
Run17: The config_used.log file will not be accurate: ignore it \\
       Half of the events for ch6 were not recorded\\
Run18: Cathode off, no CRP\\
       The last 17 events have 1 ms acquisition and should be discard

** Cosmic data with cathode off
Set selftrigger in each channel, 5k waveforms, 10us each
